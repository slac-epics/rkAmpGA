            EPICS Support for R&K GA11424BW200-5757RP
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This module contains EPICS support for the R&K GA11424BW200-5757RP
solid-state amplifier. It's based on the modbus module and asyn. 
Overall the device is quite simple, so there's not a whole lot here.

Creating an IOC
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In your RELEASE, add the following lines:

  RKAMPGA_VERSION=R1.0.0
  RKAMPGA=$(EPICS_MODULES)/rkAmpGA/$(RKAMPGA_VERSION)

In your IOC startup script:

  # Set the amplifier port. For simulation, this should be localhost
  # or loopback. For a real device, this will be a real IP, with
  # port 502 instead of 1502
  epicsEnvSet(AMP_IP, "0.0.0.0:1502")
  epicsEnvSet(AMP_PORT, "amp1") # Asyn port for the device
  epicsEnvSet(AMP_PREFIX, "amp1") # Prefix for the records

  # Execute the setup script.
  # If you want more control over setup, or don't like this pattern,
  # simply pull in the contents of this iocsh file and change as
  # necessary. Make sure not to change any addresses or sizes.
  < "${RKAMPGA}/db/GA11424BW200.iocsh"

See iocs/testIOC for a simple example.

PyDM Screen
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The PyDM screen is located at rkAmpGAApp/op/ui. Launch with the
following command:

  pydm -m 'P=myAmpPrefix' GA11424BW200.ui

Test IOC
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The test IOC can be built using:

  make BUILD_IOCS=YES

It can be run using ./run-ioc.sh. See the next section for simulating
a device.


Simulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In the sim/ directory is a JSON description of the registers in the
amp. This can be used with pymodbus' simulator feature.

NOTE: when installing pymodbus, the simulator feature may be disabled
 due to aiohttp being missing. Install that first and reinstall
 pymodbus if you encounter this issue.

The simulator may be run using ./sim/run-sym.sh or:
  
  pymodbus.simulator --json_file ./sim/setup.json

Additional Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The amplifier does not support modbus function 16 "Write multiple
   registers". It only supports 3 and 6 for RW registers, and 3 for
   read-only registers.

2. Even though the docs say the register range for forward & ref pwr
   is 10-999W, it will report 1W when not in operation, or when the
   power is too low to measure.
